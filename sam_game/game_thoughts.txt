Population Density will be directly derived from food production
Population will be directly dervied from population_density and food production
A shires abliity to produce materials will be based on its surplus food-producing population_density
Food production score is how much a single person can produce per square mile, and at default, each person can be assumed to
  work only one square mile without technology.

At a score of 1, each person should produce 1 food, and works 1 square mile.
Let's call a score of 5 the highest attainable without advanced tools. In this situation, we can have 1 person producing 1.5 food,
  and can still work one square mile.
And at a score of 10, each person produces two food per square mile. Perfection!

So a shires population will be its size * (1 + food production / 10).
  (We can set this lower beforehand, to ensure no immediate starvation)

At any given time, a shires working population will be (population - (population / (1 + food production / 10)))
The same benefits apply to minor resources. Initially, we can split work between three resources evenly.
So for each other resource,
